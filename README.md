An open-source computer vision library is called OpenCV. It gives the system the ability to identify faces or other objects. Learn about OpenCV using the Python programming language in this repository. Read and Save Picture, Canny Edge Detection, Template matching, Blob Detection, Contour, Mouse Event, Gaussian blur, and other topics are covered by OpenCV.Based on what they observe, human eyes give a wealth of information. Machines can see everything, translate it into numbers, and store it in their memory. Here, the question of how a computer turns pictures into numbers arises. The explanation is that images are transformed into numbers using the pixel value. On a digital display device, a pixel is the smallest unit of a digital picture or graphic that may be displayed and represented.![how-does-computer-recognize-the-image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125149919/220968351-64b49391-7f30-4845-bf69-49ac8a5a1b6d.png)

The numbers are a representation of the picture intensity at that specific area. The pixel values for a grayscale image in the image up top consist of just one value: the intensity of the black color there.
The images can be recognized in two ways:
1. Grayscale
Images in the grayscale format only have the colors black and white. Black is considered to have the lowest intensity whereas white has the highest intensity when calculating contrast. When we use the grayscale image, the computer values each pixel according to how dark it is.
2. RGB
The colors red, green, and blue are combined to create a new color known as an RGB. Each pixel's value is extracted by the computer, which then stores the findings in an array that may be used for analysis.

You can get OpenCV for nothing.Being developed in C/C++, the OpenCV library is extremely quick. The use of Python is now possible.It might only use 60â€“70 MB of Memory, which is less RAM than is needed.OpenCV, a computer vision program, is portable and may be used on any C-capable system.
